# Image Recognition

To create a deep neural network in Python from the grounds up and train it for image recognition. After much consideration regarding what should be the subject for recognition, I finally realised, the answer to who I should choose was simple. Pikachu! I choose you!!

We will train a deep NN to recognise Pikachu in images. 

The Jupyter Notebook with the analysis can be seen [here](Deep_Neural_Network_image_classification.ipynb)
